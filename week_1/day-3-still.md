# Numerical operations
We can carry out numerical operations using rust. Operations like addition, subtraction, division and multiplication are the most beasic types of operations that can be done using Rust programming language.

## Addition
We can perform addition by just defining the operators and operations within a variable. For example:

        let sum = 5 + 10;

running this instruction will define sum as the result of adding operators `5` and `10`

or by defining the operators in different variables and then defining them with a single vaiable. For example 

        let x = 5;
        let y = 10;
        let sum = x + y;

## Subtraction
Subtraction can be performed in a similar fashion using the minus operator

        let diff = 15 - 10;

 or 

        let x = 15;
        let y = 10;
        let diff = x - y;

## Multiplication

        let x = 5;
        let y = 10;
        let sum = x * y;
        
## Division

        let x = 50;
        let y = 10;
        let sum = x / y;
