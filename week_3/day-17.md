### `String` vs `&str` (String Slices)

#### 1. **`String`**
   - **Description**: A `String` is a growable, mutable, heap-allocated string. It’s owned, which means the memory it occupies is managed by the variable, and it can be expanded or modified.
   - **Use Cases**: Use `String` when you need a flexible string that you can modify, or when you want to own the data and not just borrow it.
   - **Creating a `String`**:
     - From a string literal: `let mut greeting = String::from("Hello");`
     - Using `.to_string()` on a `&str`: `"Hello".to_string()`

   - **Modifying a `String`**:
     - You can add to it with `.push_str()` or `.push()`:
       ```rust
       greeting.push_str(", world!"); // Adds ", world!" to the string
       greeting.push('!'); // Adds a single character
       ```
     - Concatenate by using the `+` operator or `format!`:
       ```rust
       let name = "Alice";
       let message = greeting + " " + name; // "Hello, world! Alice"
       let message = format!("{} {}", greeting, name); // Alternative with `format!`
       ```

#### 2. **`&str` (String Slice)**
   - **Description**: `&str` is a borrowed reference to a string. It’s often called a “string slice” because it references a specific part of a string (or a whole string) without owning the data.
   - **Use Cases**: Use `&str` when you want to refer to string data without owning it, like when passing data to functions without transferring ownership.
   - **Creating a `&str`**:
     - Typically, `&str` literals are written directly in code as `&str` types, like `"Hello, world!"`.
     - You can create a `&str` slice from a `String` by borrowing it with `&` or by slicing with ranges:
       ```rust
       let full_string = String::from("Hello, world!");
       let slice: &str = &full_string[0..5]; // "Hello"
       ```

### Key Differences between `String` and `&str`

| Feature              | `String`                  | `&str`                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Ownership            | Owns its data             | References borrowed data       |
| Mutability           | Mutable if declared `mut` | Immutable                      |
| Location in Memory   | Heap                      | Stack or part of another `String` on the heap |
| Use Case             | When you need to modify or own the text | When you need to reference existing text without ownership |

### Practical Example

Here’s a function that uses both `String` and `&str`:

```rust
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}

fn main() {
    let my_name = "Alice";
    let greeting = greet(my_name);
    println!("{}", greeting);
}
```

- In this example, `name` is a `&str` because it borrows the name string data. The function returns a `String` that it creates with `format!`, which allocates memory on the heap to store `"Hello, Alice!"`.

### Why Rust Has Both `String` and `&str`

Rust uses `&str` and `String` to enforce efficient memory use:
- **`String`** allows for data that you own and can modify.
- **`&str`** is faster to pass around because it doesn't require ownership, and it ensures you won’t accidentally modify or free the data it references.
